                    My final tour before leaving the military was at Joint Base Pearl-Harbor Hickam. This assignment was where I 
                    had honed and nearly perfected my software development process for the military. I had been designated one of 
                    the top innovators in the entire Air Force and was giving Air Force News Network talks on what it means to 
                    innovate on process improvements, my videos were played at the officer’s academy at Maxwell AFB as well. 
                    During this period I was awarded by the Pacific Air Forces Major Command and won prize money for my efforts 
                    to create a fully modular inventory device and to design the first holographic UI for military use in logistics.

                    My last year of the military was spent at Maxwell-Gunter Annex in Montgomery Alabama. I had been personally 
                    scouted by the Pentagon to aid the defense contractors in charge of the backend logistics infrastructure. 
                    Unfortunately all my years of winning innovation awards had made the defense contractors fear I was attempting 
                    to replace them. They had brought me under their leadership and told me I was to never do what I did again and 
                    that I was there for them to copy what they felt like, told me I might be a Russian infiltrator, that I was a 
                    threat to national security, and that I had the unauthorized ability to bring down the entire Air Force logistics 
                    infrastructure.

                    The same office that had scouted me for the position issued a cease and desist to all 10,000 of my fellow service 
                    members in my career field telling them that the defense contractor’s software that I had spent 6 years fixing was 
                    great and that they were to not use what I had made.

                    All claims were completely baseless and I demanded that they hold a court martial to prove their accusations, 
                    they refused and kept the paperwork in the lowest tier possible. After the dust settled the leadership at 
                    Maxwell constantly asked if I were contemplating suicide or arson for the remainder of my time there.

                    For what it's worth, my opinion is this, you should not have to join the military to get the basic necessities a 
                    country should offer its citizens.
