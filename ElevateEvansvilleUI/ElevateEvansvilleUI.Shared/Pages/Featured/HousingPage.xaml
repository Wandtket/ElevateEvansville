                    It’s an open secret that America is trending towards a permanent renter’s society where 
                    homes are owned by a select handful of entities that wish to passively extract wealth from 
                    the working class. The parallels between the art and real estate industries as embezzlement 
                    schemes for the ultra-wealthy grow more apparent every day.

                    I will be merging the Evansville Housing Authority, the Affordable Housing Program, and any 
                    city services that pertain to housing into a single unified entity called 
                    The Evansville Public Housing Department (EVPHD) that will be tasked with acquiring properties

                    Rather than construct new identical homes that can be easily identified as “Affordable Houses”
                    these properties will be located randomly throughout the city and will vary in size and quality, 
                    the only indicator that a house is managed by the city will be its rental price. Comparable homes 
                    will have their prices observed and the city will take that price and drastically reduce it, fueling 
                    competition and a “race to the bottom” while maintaining a high standard of living.

                    another pandemic arise.

                    I firmly believe that the cost of rent should not exceed the cost of a mortgage, if a renter pays in 
                    rent the total value of the property over the course of many years, that property must be relinquished 
                    to the renter. If the renter does not finish paying for the property before moving on, ownership of the 
                    property will be split until the other party pays back what is owed, the new renter will then pay both 
                    owners of the property, if the third renter moves on, ownership is then split again, this will keep 
                    happening until one party pays in full or the other parties relinquish ownership.
